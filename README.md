# WastePickupAPI
A skills building project to help identify when waste pickup is scheduled.

Intended to be used with voice assistants to be able to ask when waste pickups are scheduled at your home. Right now it only works for Memphis addresses.

# To do
Add more API calls for determining if a pickup is scheduled within a specified timeframe (e.g., next week, next month, etc.)

Host the web api on Azure.
